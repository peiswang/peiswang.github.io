collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-03-15-tpami-bitsplit-09
excerpt: 'This is an extention of our BitSplit method published in ICML 2020. We add extensive theoretical and experimental analysis and compare with more recent SOTA methods. Importantly, we analyze the effect of calibration set on the performance of Post-training Network Quantization, which is widely ignored by previous works.'
